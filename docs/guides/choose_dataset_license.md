# Choosing a license for your dataset

When sharing microscopy data derived datasets, selecting an appropriate license is crucial for ensuring the proper use and distribution of your work. Different licenses offer varying degrees of freedom and control over your data. Here, we outline some popular licenses, their key features, and considerations to help you choose the right one for your needs.

## Considerations for Choosing a License

- **Intended Use**: Determine whether you want your data to be used freely or with certain restrictions, such as non-commercial use only.
- **Credit and Attribution**: Decide if you want to receive credit for your work and if itâ€™s important for you to see how others are using your data.
- **Derivative Works**: Consider whether you want derivative works to be allowed and if they should be shared under the same terms.
- **Commercial Use**: Reflect on whether you want to permit commercial use of your data. Your institution may have specific policies regarding commercial use.

## Licenses
The following are some common licenses used for sharing data on the web, which we also use on the SynDB platform.

!!! tip "Use ODC over CC"
    **We recommend the ODC licenses for datasets on SynDB.** You are free to use Creative Commons licenses as well, just note that they are not designed for data. The default license for SynDB is ODC-BY.

### Open Data Commons (ODC) Licenses
Open Data Commons (ODC) licenses are specifically tailored for datasets and databases, focusing on maximizing accessibility and proper attribution in data sharing.

#### PDDL (Public Domain Dedication and License)
Places the dataset in the public domain, allowing unrestricted use and maximizing openness and usability.

#### ODC-BY (Attribution License)
Allows use with proper credit to the original creator, ensuring acknowledgment while enabling broad use.

#### ODC-ODbL (Open Database License)
Permits sharing, modifying, and using the dataset with attribution and requires derivative databases to be shared under the same license, promoting open access and collaborative improvement while keeping derivative databases equally accessible.

### Creative Commons (CC) Licenses
Creative Commons (CC) licenses are versatile and well-suited for a wide range of creative works, including datasets

#### CC0 (Public Domain Dedication)
Allows the use of the dataset without any restrictions, making it ideal for maximizing usability and dissemination.

#### CC BY (Attribution)
Allows users to use the dataset as long as they provide appropriate credit to the original creator, ensuring wide use while acknowledging the creator's work.

#### CC BY-SA (Attribution-ShareAlike)
Permits use of the dataset with appropriate credit and requires sharing derivative works under the same license, keeping derivative works open and shareable under the same terms.

#### CC BY-NC (Attribution-NonCommercial)
Allows use for non-commercial purposes with proper credit, restricting use to non-commercial purposes while still enabling academic and research use.

#### CC BY-NC-SA (Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike)
Permits non-commercial use with appropriate credit and sharing of derivative works under the same license, ensuring non-commercial use and open sharing under the same terms.

## Conclusion

Selecting the right license for your microscopy data derived dataset is essential for controlling how your data is used and ensuring it meets your sharing objectives. By considering the options and your specific needs, you can choose a license that balances openness, credit, and control, fostering collaboration and advancement in your field.
