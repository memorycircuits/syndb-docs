# Quick start

## Command line interface
Following the installation, you may run the SynDB CLI using the following command:
```bash
syndb
```
The internal documentation of the CLI will guide you through the available commands and options. See the [upload documentation](../dataset/2-upload.md) for uploading with the CLI.

## Graphical user interface
After installing the SynDB CLI, which contains the GUI, you may run the GUI using the following command:

```bash
syndb gui
```

The GUI will open in your default web browser, and in case the browser is already open, a new tab will be created. You might also have to refresh the new page to see the GUI.

!!! tip "Dark Mode"
    Use the [dark reader](https://darkreader.org/) extension for dark mode in the GUI.
